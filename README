My personal configuration files and scripts.

Installation
-------------
To run the installer you need to have git already installed.

Just run `./install.sh` in the top-level directory.
The installer will ask you which configurations you wish to apply.

Each configuration bundle contains its own install script, which can also be
run from its directory.

Feel free to install only the pieces you want and need.

Update
-------
For now, you can do a `git pull` to get the last changes from upstream.

You can additionally run the installer again, in order to install any new
configuration bundles.
